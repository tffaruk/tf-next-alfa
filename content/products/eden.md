### Short Description

We live in a very tech savvy world, and when it comes down to the travel or the hotel industry, you can pretty confidently bet that your travellers are tech savvy and will want to book online as opposed to coming to the place or calling. Not just booking, they would also want to have a look at what your hotel provides and what they can expect for their buck. That being true, you’ve got a very significant task here. That is, put your hotel not just on the physical map, but also on the map where the customers are- The Internet. To do that you may need to carry out the daunting task of making an entire website from scratch. If you’re not a developer, that might be one of the hardest things you’ll have to do by yourself. This is precisely where Eden helps you out. At a striking $14, you get a wonderful looking hotel booking website template that is perefect for your hotel and getting your business on the grid looking fabulous. Eden seeks to meticulously test and perfect every nook and cranny of the template so that your trust on the template isn’t compromised.

Eden is easy on the eyes along with all the functionalities you may require for the best look for your hotel. It focuses on the Booking process in the Homepage but on top of that too you have other functionalities enumerated here. And if you’re convinced, don’t forget to check out the Live Preview of the template.

### 33 HTML Pages

Whatever information you may need to put on your hotel website, Eden has a solution for you. With 33 different HTML pages to pick from, you can showcase everything starting from rooms to the availability to the extra amenities you provide with the aid of these pages.

### Fixed and Static header

The booking steps are neatly and easily cut out for ease of use for the customer and you can also make the best use of it to get reservations from customers before they even step out of their house.

You don’t have to pay a thousand dollars extra to make changes to the look of the website anymore. Eden is flexible when it comes to customization so you can rest assured you will get exactly the look that you’re searching for.
