## What is a Static Site Generator (SSG)?

Static Site Generators are different from CMS-based website creators. It assists developers in creating quicker, lightweight, and static websites. You can create a visually enhanced website within a short period with an SSG.

While building your static site, you will be using templates and raw data for a headless CMS. Most importantly, without taking the coding headache, you will be doing it via HTML.

Static site generators (SSG) combine data and content with templates to create a page view that will be provided to site visitors.  The most significant distinction between SSG and regular web app stack is that a static site generator produces a page's view in advance. So, it does not delay until it is requested or each time it is demanded. It displays the requested page during the build time.

Consider a static site generator as a script that receives data, content, and templates, process them, and generates a folder containing all the web pages and resources.

It has a variety of beneficial consequences, the most notable of which is that you can transfer this work away from "request time" (whenever users desire a page view) towards "build time," which is irrelevant when users request a page view. This " decoupled " structure breaks the link between the number of visitors to a site and the expense of generating the views to support all those visits is broken by this "decoupled" structure.

## Why Should You Choose A Static Site Generator?

Static site generators are the essential element of Jamstack application development. Most of the benefits of Jamstack are visible because of the best static site generators. So, let’s see why you should choose one to create your next website crafting project.

If you’ve considered that static assets should be hosted through CDN rather than depending on web servers. As a consequence, you will be getting all the elements prepared for launching a lightning-fast site.

### Reliable Security Standards

Although you cannot say that a website is completely safe, static sites have a limited number of attack routes. There isn't any database to break into, no application server to jeopardize. There is no web server that can be accessed by operating at the edge of a CDN. Jamstack apps mostly depend on third-party services for build-time or run-time data. But those data come with their own set of risks.

Static site generators do not go down like traditional server-side apps. This is because there is no database connection that can fail, no server that can go down, no runtime issues that can result in a failure. But if a build fails due to an error, the site will continue to function with previously created assets. If your website faces a sudden surge in traffic, static assets scale with it.

### Beyond Static

If you are thinking "Static" means limited functionality in your site then you are wrong. However, you are biased if you are thinking your site is dynamic and you can't use a static site generator to build a site similar to it. But don't be fooled by the usage of Static. Static sites can perform practically anything a server-based web app or site can. All you need to do is utilize the proper API services at build time and on the client-side.

Generally, Static site generators contain dynamic content. This is exactly what they are designed for but during build time instead of run time. This feature can originate from a source containing JSON, YAML, or Markdown data or API.

It has become a common practice to use a third-party headless content management system to produce static assets on a static website. The content is often retrieved from the API during the build process in order to produce static assets using the SSG.

Client-side JavaScript is utilized to maintain dynamic features of a site during the build time. Even though the assets generated by an SSG are static, they might nonetheless be quite dynamic on the client. With static site generators, you can create comprehensive single-page applications that work just like dynamically like every other online application.

These are the services available to implement dynamic features in Static Sites:
