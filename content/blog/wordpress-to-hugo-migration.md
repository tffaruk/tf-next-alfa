### Intense Website Speed

In the current era of a technological revolution, anything slow means you are wasting money, investment, effort, and all. Since online users generally abandon a site if the loading time exceeds 3 seconds, you shouldn't overlook your site speed.

Hugo is a one-of-a-kind framework that outsmarts other websites with its blistering speed. This is because it won't need to build a page every time for each visitor. When it comes to loading your site, the framework works incredibly fast.

### Powerful Content Management

Hugo was created with content managers and authors in mind, not only coders or developers.  It is an ideal platform that has taken content management to the next level. With this static site generator, you can manage various content types, taxonomies, menu patterns, dynamic API-driven content, and more. The best part is that you don't need to rely on plugins or third-party dependencies to manage all the contents.

### Enhanced Security

Intruders may want to hack your website for various reasons. Unauthorized users can gain financial profit through traffic hijacking, anonymous advertising, authenticity spoofing, malware hosting, etc. WordPress is based on PHP, and it has a downward reputation due to its security vulnerabilities.

In WordPress, pages are built from various assets, which open a doorway for hackers to add malicious code. WordPress plugin brings the same vulnerabilities to the ecosystem. Static site generators such as Hugo, on the other hand, are largely immune to security flaws. It doesn't need much server-side functionality and is less vulnerable to hackers.

### Shortcodes Applicable

Hugo’s shortcodes are secretly powering up the Markdown. Shortcodes are like a magic wand that can extend the basic functionalities of the contents and posts with your magical imagination.

Hugo honors the markdown’s simplicity, but there are moments when you feel the necessity to expand the flexibility. Hugo shortcodes will provide you with the flexibility that you need to make your theme outstanding.

Since Hugo supports multiple languages, you can call Hugo a polyglot website-building framework. Hugo offers comprehensive i18n support for multi-language sites while maintaining the same simple site development experience that you will get while developing single-language sites.

### Pre-Built Templates

Hugo includes built-in templates that will significantly minimize your site-building effort instantly. The template engine utilizes the GO HTML/template library. All these templates in Hugo include a sufficient amount of logic to create a static website.

Hugo templates will make your website building process hassle-free. This is because the templates include major factors such as SEO, commenting, analytics, and more. One line of code will make a massive difference to your site-building process.

### Flexible Hosting and Deployment

Hugo works flexibly in every environment. It’s a cross-platform compatible framework that allows a simple setup process on macOS, Linux, Windows, and other operating systems.

Hugo generates static websites, so you can host your Hugo-based site almost anywhere. Netlify and Vercel are two well-known hosting companies, although there are many <A href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/">more.</A>

At this point, we will be revealing the process of WordPress to Hugo migration. It's not overwhelming, but there are a few steps that you need to follow to complete this process.

### Hugo Installation

To begin with, you need to <A href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">install Hugo</A>, which is completely covered in their documentation. The Hugo binary Generates the static HTML from markdown and template files that we will be using later.

* Google page speed of the theme

But if you want to use a high-quality premium theme, you can visit <A href="https://gethugothemes.com/" rel="follow" >Gethugothemes</A>, where you will get a vast collection of remarkable premium Hugo themes.

### Exporting WordPress site’s content for Hugo

Hugo utilizes the markdown files to store all its contents. So, all the information is kept in flat files. Though it takes a considerable amount of time to transit from WordPress to Hugo, there are several alternatives for moving:

* **<A href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">WordPress-to-hugo-exporter</A>:** It's a one-click WordPress plugin that can transform all the contents to Hugo-compatible Markdown and YAML.
* **<A href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/">Jekyll Exporter</A>:**  You can also download the Jekyll Exporter to convert your WordPress website’s posts, pages, and settings into Hugo format.
* **<A href="https://github.com/wooni005/exitwp-for-hugo">Exitwp-for-hugo</A>:** It's a python script that effectively transforms WordPress contents (pages & posts) to Hugo format ( Markdown and YAML )  using the XML export via WordPress.
* **<A href="https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md">blog2md</A>:** Yet another WordPress to Hugo migrator, which is basically a node package created to parse the .xml file. Also, it saves approved comments within the YOUR-POST-NAME-comments.md file as well as the posts.

We recommend you use the Wordpres-to-hugo-exporter plugin to complete this process. First of all, install the plugin named <A href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">wordpress-to-hugo-exporter</A>.

Though you won’t be getting the plugin in the WordPress Plugin repository or the dashboard. But you can download it from GitHub and upload it to your WordPress website to install and activate it.

* **Step 1:** Go to the Git <A href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">repo</A> and download a zipped version of the plugin.
* **Step 2:** Head back to your WordPress dashboard and then go to **Plugins > Add New**.
* **Step 3:** Click the **Upload Plugin** button and select the plugin's ZIP file that you downloaded earlier.
* **Step 4:** When the installation process is finished, **Activate** the plugin.
* **Step 5: Go** to **Tools> Export** **to Hugo** after the installation process, which might take some time to load.

If it works properly, you will be given a ZIP file with the following contents:

* All the posts and pages available on your last website
* The files that you've uploaded (/wp-content/*)

However, you may not be successful in your first attempt, which is normal. If the site you are converting is too large, the ZIP file creation process will fail. Therefore, you can try the process via CLI.

Now, you can begin with SSH into your server. If you are not aware of the SSH process, you can ask for your host’s assistance.

<Code lang="php">
{`
cd wp-content/plugins/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter-master/
php hugo-export-cli.php

`}
</Code>

**This is your file!**

<Code lang="bash">
{`
/tmp/wp-hugo.zip

`}
</Code>

This process may also take some time to complete. At this point, the ZIP file that contains all your site's content is ready, and it's quite a useful backup that you can utilize.

<Code lang="bash">
{`
$ ls -alh /tmp/wp-hugo.zip
294M Apr  10 07:25 /tmp/wp-hugo.zip

`}
</Code>

Now, you may download the file and extract it to your system’s local directory.

### Fix Small Issues in Each Post

This process requires your patience since it will take a significant amount of time and effort.

Keep in mind that each post requires a lot of minor adjustments, including:

* Frontmatter fixing like image path, URLs, etc.
* Ensure that the current URL slug is the same as the old one
* Omit WordPress shortcodes or plugin dependencies and replace them with Hugo shortcodes.
* Search and replace images from the URL path and put them in the relative path.
* Find and replace character strings created by escape characters `(_, *, [, -, <_, _)` that are random.
* Use a lot of regexes to find inter-blog links, bold texts, underlined text, strike-through text, etc.

### Exploring The Exported WordPress Data

In WordPress, a specific folder structure remains intact even if you export it. Therefore,  if you unzip the exported file, you will get the following folder structure:

<Code lang="bash">
{`
config.yaml
posts/
_2020-04-01-post-1.md
_ 2020-04-02-post-2.md
_2020-04-03-post-3.md
about/
_ index.md
wp-content/
_uploads/
_ 2020/
_ 2021/

`}
</Code>

As you can see, the unzipped file includes **config.yaml,** which contains your website's metadata. The metadata contains data such as title, description, etc. Moreover, the exported folder contains all the posts and pages of the WordPress site.

Make sure that all the data are exported properly, and then start using the data in the Hugo environment.

### Using WordPress Website’s Data in Hugo Environment

You may utilize your WordPress website’s data in the Hugo environment by following our mentioned steps.

**Step 1:** Create a new Hugo project

<Code lang="bash">
{`
hugo new site sitename
cd sitename

`}
</Code>

**Step 2:** When you are ready with your new Hugo website, copy all the previously exported data into it.

<Code lang="bash">
{`
cp -r /path/to/hugo-export/ content/

`}
</Code>

You may copy the folders from the exported file into the "**content**" directory of Hugo. The final output should look like this:

<Code lang="bash">
{`
archetypes/
content/
posts/
_2020-04-01-post-1.md
_ 2020-04-02-post-2.md
_2020-04-03-post-3.md
about/
_ index.md
wp-content/
_uploads/
_ 2020/
_ 2021/
data/
themes/
layouts/
config.toml
\[...\]

`}
</Code>

**Step 3:** You can choose and apply your preferred theme on Hugo and then observe for testing purposes. So, we will show you the easiest way of applying the Hugo theme to your migrated website.

* Download the BigSpring theme in your local directory. You can get the free theme from the GitHub <A href="https://github.com/themefisher/bigspring-light">repository</A> or get the premium theme from the official <A href="https://gethugothemes.com/products/bigspring/">site</A>.
* After downloading the theme file, unzip the file in your local directory. Now rename the folder from **bigspring-light-master** to **bigspring-light**.
* Now, you need to copy the bigspring-light folder and go to your Hugo project folder. Then paste the downloaded theme into the **Theme** folder located in your project folder.
* If you have the premium theme, extract the file, get inside the downloaded theme folder, copy the Themes folder, and paste it inside the project folder you’ve created.
* You will get config.toml file inside the Bigspring (both free & pro) theme folder. You need to edit the file and change the theme name inside the file as theme = “bigspring-hugo.”

That’s it, and now your site is ready to get launched in the Hugo environment using the Bigspirng theme.

**Step 4:** Since the last command will start a local Hugo server, you can browse it to view the site in Hugo.

You’ve successfully transferred all the data of your WordPress website to the Hugo platform. Now you can customize an existing theme or create an excellent theme from scratch on this amazing platform.
