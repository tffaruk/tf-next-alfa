## What is VPS | Hostinger VPS Hosting

As the name suggests, Virtual Private Server is one that is just yours, with all its exclusivity. You wouldn’t need to share your hosting with anyone else, it’s dedicated to you and your needs only. What dedicated really means here is that you don’t need to share your CPU, Ram, or Disk space. The virtual part here refers to the fact that you get a separate partition for yourself on an actual physical server.

And since it is exclusively yours, you have the ability to gain root access, load it up with the OS of your liking and you’re good to go- free to make it yours and work the way you want to. If you have a decent dose of technical knowledge, and your shared hosting is just not working for you anymore, it’s time to get your own Virtual Private Server.

One of the best providers of VPS is hostinger. With the VPS, hostinger promises the highest server reliability and performance. You can pick from 6 variations, starting from 1 GB all the way up to 8 GB, with varying bandwidths too. You can pick from 6 Linux-based operating system templates but CentOS is perhaps the best for VPS.

Speaking from a user’s point of view, it’s quite safe to say that you along with most other users on the planet hate slow loading websites, prompting us to leave the website if it doesn’t load in the first couple of seconds. With that notion in mind, Hostinger promises speed that is almost unbeaten in the industry. From our usage, it is quite obvious that the page loading time outcompeted most of the other hosting providers in the market with a jaw-dropping load time of 384ms. They weren’t kidding when they said their speed performance is ‘superior’.

## 2. Guaranteed 99.9% Uptime

The whole point of having a website is to ensure you’re always available and accessible to users. For that, it is a no-brainer that your website needs to be online all the time. Hostinger promises that they provide 99.9% online, and with the occasional downtimes that are normal for any website hosting, they do a pretty decent job at keeping the site LIVE.

For most people who are starting off with their own websites, building it is the most formidable task out there. But when your hosting provider also helps you out with building that website with striking templates that actually stand out, ditching the generic themes that make every other webpage look the same. These themes are gorgeous, customizable, and easy to use. Hostinger ensures that you can create exactly what you’re looking for. At the time being, Hostinger is providing a free domain, but only for its paid plans and not the free ones.

## 5. Superb Email Tools

Hostinger provides some of the best Email tools that you can find in the market. With the free plan you get one, but with any of the other plans, you get unlimited emails which make communication a breeze for any person starting off with a website. You get options such as Email forwarder, autoresponders, and spam assassin protection. The site owner can also access their emails from anywhere they are, as well as manage their accounts. This is one of their best features and provides to customers exactly what they need.

## 6. Pricing

Even with the great features, it packs, Hostinger is very pocket-friendly which is what makes this hosting such a good deal for small-scale entrepreneurs. The emails, the CPanel, unlimited bandwidth, and database are some features that are great for the price you pay, as these are only available with the paid plans. The best part is, if your experience isn’t up to par, you can always get a refund since Hostinger provides a 30-day money-back option.

However, not all is good in the hood for any hosting you might look into. As expected, there are some minor downsides of Hostinger too. They are:

## 1.No traditional CPanel

Even though they provide Cpanel with hostinger, they have recreated it to their own interface. Even though their hearts were in the right place when they did this, it might become frustrating for those who are used to the traditional way that CPanel used to work. This will not a deal-breaker for new users but experienced users may not be thrilled at the loss of familiarity that they were used to.

## 2. Must Pay for Extra Domain

Even though the first domain is provided for free (with the paid plans), if you need a second or third one, it might soon escalate financially. You get unlimited subdomains, but the main domain is limited to only one unless you pay extra for it.

## 3. Loopholes in pricing

Hostinger has also resorted to tricky pricing like many of its industry counterparts. When it says you can get ridiculously low prices, it comes only when you commit to this hosting for 3 years. For any period of time less than that, it is not as pocket-friendly as it claims to be. Nonetheless, it is still cheaper compared to a lot of other hosting providers in the market. Even the refund policy has its loopholes, which you can find out from their website if you know what you’re looking for.

The verdict:  
No hosting provider is perfect, but they can nearly be perfect. With hostinger VPS hosting, you get a ton of greatness for the price you pay and if you’re not looking for something extremely extravagant, chances are you will not be disappointed with Hostinger. We can safely say that it is great value for your money, along with being very easy to use.
