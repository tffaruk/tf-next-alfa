## Caching; simply explained

Explained simply, ‘Caching’ helps your website load faster by letting the server skip the processing part and loading multiple requests, pages, scripts, etc. when your website is visited repeatedly.

Finally, the retrieved content is sent to your web browser in the form of the website’s home page or any other page you requested.

However, when you repeatedly visit the same website, the server plays smart (if caching is in place) and provides you with a cached copy of the website which is stored with it in the form of an already prepared HTML file.
