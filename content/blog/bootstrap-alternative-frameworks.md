No doubt, Bootstrap is one of the most used and well-developed CSS frameworks. It has greatly minimized the workload of the developers. As it comes with many in-built functionalities, it doesn’t require much effort to make a stunning website quickly.

But, it also comes with some drawbacks. Firstly, it comes with a lot of unnecessary codes and files that make a website slow to load. As loading time is a very significant factor in SEO, it is better to look for something else that helps to load a page more swiftly. Secondly, all the websites made using Bootstrap looks similar. If you want to stand apart from the crowd, either you need to make huge customization in your Bootstrap coding that may take a lot of time or you can opt to move into a new alternative framework.
