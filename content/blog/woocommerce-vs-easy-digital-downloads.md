After getting determined to start a new online business using WordPress, people are usually searching for the right way, to begin with. One of the most common questions they have been asked by themselves “which plugins will successfully meet their need? Woocommerce vs easy digital downloads”

And apparently, all of them are looking for the best eCommerce plugin for their new online business. We know the fact because we were also in the same stage in 2015 while ThemeFisher has started the journey.

In the beginning, we have started by using WooCommerce as it seems like the king of the WordPress eCommerce world. After one year, we move to Easy Digital Download while facing some significant problems as a Digital Store using WooCommerce.

Here, we are going to share our knowledge and experience about both of these platforms. You may define this article as "A case study by ThemeFisher for choosing a WordPress eCommerce platform to build a digital store."

## Behind the story

As I early mentioned that our journey began in 2015 and at that time we choose WooCommerce as it is the most popular WordPress eCommerce solution. While running our online store, we faced some problems to cope up with WooCommerce.

In the beginning, Themefisher provided fantastic free HTML & Bootstrap website templates. Our user can get those free templates after completing a few phases, which are built-in phases of WooCommerce itself.

It seems all of our users need to go through all the general steps of WooCommerce, Add to cart, provide billing details, proceed checkout, and after that, they can able to download the free items which took a considerable time.

Sometimes people lose their interest while facing up this kind of hassles even for a free product and they give up, that hamper our business and we lost a huge number of visitors. We always wanted to be flexible, being painful to our users is not our business motivation, and unfortunately, WooCommerce did not meet our needs.

Then after one year, we move to Easy Digital Downloads which make us super flexible to our users. Now a user can download a free product without facing those kinds of long processes, they provide just their email address and get the product in their inbox.

EDD improves the usability of our business by more than 3X, and in the back-end, it generates a report for every single product of our digital store.

Now we can monitor the number of downloads of a product on day to day basis. I also prefer to mention the customer profile page EDD has. While WooCommerce sorts by orders, and then you can filter by a customer, EDD summarizes all the purchases of a single customer, on one page.

## WooCommerce vs Easy Digital Downloads - Which one should pick?

We gather experience about both of WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. Both of these are for selling products online, but in our observation, it seems these two are specialized in different areas. While WooCommerce is perfect for those stores where SHIPPING is involved, the Easy Digital Download suits best with the store for digital goods such as ebooks, PDFs, plugins, themes, etc.

> **As a result, we think, the whole WooCommerce vs Easy Digital Downloads debate can be solved with a single question: "what are you selling?"**

If you are selling PHYSICAL products and SHIPPING is involved, then WooCommerce will rock it. WooCommerce is exactly built for Physical products, to manage shipping costs and stock management.

Or if you are selling DIGITAL products which do not need any shipping and are able to attach a file to a product and automatically deliver that file after payment is made then Easy Digital Download will be the best.

Both of these two giant plugins have their set of 3features, pros, and as well as some cons also. In this section, we are going to give a brief of these circumstances, from the perspective of our experience.
